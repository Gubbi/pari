//! Workspace layer — caller-facing async API.
//!
//! [`Workspace`] is the bounded session of entity work over a
//! [`Dispatcher`](crate::store::Dispatcher) into the store layer.
//! [`XViewer<'ws, T>`](XViewer) wraps a tracked entity bound to that
//! session for read-side use; [`XEditor<'ws, T>`](XEditor) wraps a
//! viewer and adds the per-field setters and consume-on-finish
//! lifecycle returned by `Workspace::checkout`.
//!
//! Anyone can construct a workspace; multiple workspaces over the same
//! store coexist. The type↔erased conversion at the workspace↔store
//! boundary is handled here — downstream layers see only `AnyEntityRef`
//! and `TrackedEntity`.
//!
//! See `docs/design/layers/workspace.md` for the L3 design.
