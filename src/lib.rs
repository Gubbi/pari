//! Pari — workflow runtime for hybrid human-agent teams.
//!
//! The runtime is organized around the formal `entity`, `workspace`, `store`,
//! `substrate`, and `error` layers.
//!
//! Process setup happens through one of two entry points:
//!
//! - [`init`] publishes a process-wide [`StoreServer`] and spawns the
//!   [`Store`] actor future via a caller-provided [`SpawnFn`].
//! - [`with`] runs a closure against a thread-local store server and
//!   drives the actor future internally — used by tests so they need
//!   no runtime-specific spawner.

#![feature(error_generic_member_access)]
#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]
#![allow(clippy::must_use_candidate)]

// Allow `::pari::...` paths in proc-macro-generated code to resolve within
// this crate itself (needed when #[derive(Entity)] is applied inside `pari`).
